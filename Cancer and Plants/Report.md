# Cancer and Plants

Cancer is a disease caused when cells divide uncontrollably and spread into surrounding tissues. As a disease with a high mortality rate and low rehabilitation rate, cancer is the most leading cause of death, excluding heart disease and cancer rate becomes a vital indicator to measure public health.  According to the [report](https://www.who.int/zh/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer) of WHO: Lung cancer is the most common cancer. Besides,  personal behavior factors (smoking, drinking, unhealthy diet and lack of exercise), physical, chemical and biological carcinogens( air pollution and exposure to asbestos) are also dangerous lung cancer-causing agents. As we know, the industrial sites are the main source of air pollution. Thus this project will explore the correlation factories and cancer, figuring out whether industrial sites should be responsible for cancer rate.

The visualization above shows the cancer rate information per county, this project explores cancer from 4 aspects: (If you are in need of the larger images, please click  on the names of the images. )
* The top-left plot is  [` Age-Adjusted Cancer Case per 100,000 per County`](images/Case_age.png). It shows the cancer rates per county. Because cancer outcomes occur at different rates in different age groups. In order to remove confounding caused by age, the project considers Age adjustment here. 
* The top-right plot is  [`Average Annual Case per County`](images/avg_case.png) It shows the average number of cancer cases per county.
* The bottom-left plot is [`Cancer Case Incidence Rates per County`](images/Incidence_Rates.png) It shows the incidence rate trend, which is the trend of the rate of occurrence per year of new cases, per county.
* The bottom-right plot is [`Cancer Case Trend per County`](images/trend.png).  It shows the trends of case.
