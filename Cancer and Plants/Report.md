Besides,  personal behavior factors (smoking, drinking, unhealthy diet and lack of exercise), physical, chemical and biological carcinogens( air pollution and exposure to asbestos) are also dangerous lung cancer-causing agents.

Thus this project will explore the correlation factories and cancer, figuring out whether industrial sites should be responsible for cancer rate.
